===============================================================
 Announcing Blosc *** VERSION HERE ***
 A blocking, shuffling and lossless compression library
===============================================================

What is new?
============

Much improved compression ratio when using large blocks (> 64 KB) and
high compression levels (> 6) under some circumstances (special data
distribution).

For more info, please see the RELEASE_NOTES.txt file.

What is it?
===========

Blosc (http://blosc.pytables.org) is a high performance compressor
optimized for binary data.  It has been designed to transmit data to
the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed,
direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call.

Blosc is the first compressor (that I'm aware of) that is meant not
only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but
also to accelerate memory-bound computations.
