Changes from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4
===========================

- Support for cross-platform big/little endian compatibility in Blosc
  headers has been added.


Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.3
===========================

- Fixed several nasty bugs uncovered by the new suites in bench.c.
  Thanks to Tony Theodore and Gabriel Beckers for their (very)
  responsive beta testing and feedback.

- Added several modes (suites), namely ``suite``, ``hardsuite`` and
  ``extremehardsuite`` in bench.c so as to allow different levels of
  testing.


Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.9
=========================

- Internal format version bumped to 2 in order to allow an easy way to
  indicate that a buffer is being saved uncompressed.  This is not
  supported yet, but it might be in the future.

- Blosc can use threads now for leveraging the increasing number of
  multi-core processors out there.  See README-threaded.txt for more
  info.

- Added a protection for MacOSX so that it has to not link against
  posix_memalign() funtion, which seems not available in old versions of
  MacOSX (for example, Tiger).  At nay rate, posix_memalign() is not
  necessary on Mac because 16 bytes alignment is ensured by default.
  Thanks to Ivan Vilata.  Fixes #3.
